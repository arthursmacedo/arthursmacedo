# Hello! üëãüèΩ ‚Äî I'm Arthur

Sanitation Technician (IFG) | Geophysicist (UnB) | M.Sc. Candidate in Geophysics (IAG-USP)

Member of [CompGeoLab](https://www.compgeolab.org)

## About Me

I am a Sanitation Technician from the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Goi√°s (IFG) and a Geophysicist graduated from the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB). Currently, I am a Master's candidate in Geophysics at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of S√£o Paulo (IAG-USP). I am also an active member of CompGeoLab.

## Current Projects

- **Integration of airborne geophysics datasets with gradient-boosted equivalent sources on the sphere**: Working on integrating geophysical methods to enhance regional mapping accuracy using spherical coordinates.

## Past Projects

  - Investigations on the magnetic properties of soils affected by fires;
  - Infrasound data analysis;
  - Analysis of infrasonic events and their correlations with geomagnetic storms;
  - Computational geophysics project involving the automation of well tie using optimization techniques;
  - Curie Surface in the Borborema Province and its Implications for Lithospheric Heat Flow.


## Interests

- **Geophysics**: Exploration and modeling of geophysical phenomena;
- **Python Programming**: Development of tools for geophysical data analysis and visualization;
- **Open Science**: Promoting open, reproducible, and accessible research practices.
